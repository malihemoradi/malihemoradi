I'm Malihe Moradi, strong engineering professional with a Bachelor's degree focused in Computer Software Engineering. Skilled in Java, Kotlin, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), with more than 8 years of experience in building mobile applications.

A fast learner who never stops learning. There is not a single day in my life in which I didn’t learn something new. I believe in hard work and I’m the kind of person who gets the job done, no matter what. I love to learn more and teach whatever I guide to others. 
Write clean, performant, and maintainable code, care about automated tests, good documentation, and effective processes.
